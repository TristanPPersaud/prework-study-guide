# <Tristan Persaud's Prework Study Guide>

## Description

My motivation for creating this study guide was to aide and assist both myself and other bootcamp students in completing their pre work, and creating a space to retain organized, easy to access notes for review.
This project was built because as a programming bootcamp student you will be receiving various types of important information and an incredibly rapid pace. This amount of info needs to be stored somewhere in an organzied fashion so that it may be easily accessed and reviewed. This project was also built to as a foundational stepping stone in my programming career inrtoducing me to topics like git, git flow, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Chrome dev tool kit, and operating the terminal just to name a few. 


## Installation
