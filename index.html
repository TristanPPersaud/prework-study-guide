        <h2>HTML</h2>
    
        <ul>
    
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of three cornerstone programming languages.</li>
          <li>HTML creates the structure of the webpage.</li>
          <li>Webpage is comprised of types of content called elements.</li>
          <li>Common elements which add content include: Text, Image, Header, and List.</li>
          <li>Common elements which divide and describe webpage: Meta-related elements, Content division elements, and Semantic elements.</li>
          <li>Elements are contained between an opening and closing tag.</li>
          <li>Element refers to everything between opening and closing tag. Tag refers to what is inside brackets.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The meta element contains information about metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>Metadata is information the browser uses to provide our webpage to users. Metadata is not seen by users.</li>
          <li>The charset element defined by the head element sets programmers character encoding.</li>
          <li>The http-equiv element defined by the head element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The viewport element sets the default view for a programmers webpage.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage which is important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements defined by the body element are called "child elements".</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements describe its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Semantic elements make HTML easier to read by developers and browsers.</li>
          <li>The body element is a semantic element.</li>
          <li>Non-semantic elements include div to create a division in the page or span to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>The section element defines a section in a document that holds thematic content.</li>
          <li>The h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 elements represent the heading (larger text) of a website.</li>
          <li>The number in the heading element determines the size of heading, 1 being the largest and 6 the smallest.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or passage. The p element contains text on webpages.</li>
          <li>The ul element (unordered list), ol element (ordered list), and li element (list item) are used to create and represent lists.</li>
          <li>The img element containes information about images on webpage. Contains defining attributes like src, alt, width, and height.</li>
          <li>The src attribute defines location of image.</li>
          <li>The alt attribute defines the image.</li>
          <li>The width attribute defines width of image.</li>
          <li>The height attribute defines the height of an image.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line break between content.</li>
          <li>The a (anchor) element creates link to webpages.</li>
          <li>The href attribute includes the URL being reached by the a element.</li>
          <li>The footer element is at the bottom of the page and contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>

        <ul>
      
          <li>Cascading style sheets, (CSS), is a programming language that is used to define webpage content presentation.  </li>
          <li>Three ways to style a webpage include inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS stylesheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS applys stle to a specific HTML tag.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet implements an entire style sheet into the HTML file by using he style element in the head element.</li>
          <li>External style sheet is linked into the HTML seperating the CSS rules to another file.</li>
          <li>External style sheets are linked through the link element placed in the HTML head element.</li>
          <li>The link element has a rel component, defining what is being linked, and an href component, the actual link to the content.</li>
          <li>A CSS rule is comprised of a selector and a declaration made up of a property and its chosen value.</li>
          <li>The * is used as a selector to apply a CSS rule to all elements on a page.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The text align property is a positioning property and can be used to center text.</li>
          <li>The img selector is used to assign property values to ant images.</li>
          <li>Property values may also be edited for lists, ul, and text, p.</li>
          <li>Class selectors may be assigned to HTML elements.</li>
          <li>Class selectors allow for any assigned HTML elements to have property values applied to them as a group.</li>

        <ul>
      
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>

          <li>git flow is the process of saving and commiting edits to files from the local repository to the remote repository.</li>
          <li>first add -A commits all files in working branch, then git commit -m "name" to commit files to remote repository, then git pull origin main to make sure current branch is up to date syncing repositories, then git push origin feature/"name" to push all changes to github repository, finally create pull request on github and merge branches.</li>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        
        <ul>
        
          <li>Javascript is a programming language that is used to add interactivity to websites.</li>
          <li>Javascript must be linked to the index.html file.</li>
          <li>Javascript is linked just before the body wraps through script src = ("java file name").</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container used for storing data in code.</li>
          <li>The const keyword creates a variable that is permanent and can not be reassigned.</li>
          <li>After the const keyword a variable is given a unique name used to referance information stored in variables.</li>
          <li>The assignment operator = is used to assign data to be stored in the variable.</li>
          <li>A string is a variable that includes multiple pieces of data.</li>
          <li>Strings are always contained in quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Every line of javascript code ends in a semicolon.</li>
          <li>The console.log method outputs messages to the web console.</li>
          <li>Chrome Dev tools can be used to view elements and console log in browser.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computter executes code. Java runs from the first statement at the top to the last at the bottom of script.</li>
          <li>Conditional statements and loops can be used to alter control flow.</li>
          <li>An if statement introduces decision making to code. Code will only execute if conditions are met or is true.</li>
          <li>Javascript checks to see if condition is truthy, if considered truthy it will execute the code.</li>
          <li>Javascript considereds a value falsy if it contains the value 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, Nan, or a Boolean data with the value false.</li>
          <li>Else if can be used to provide more conditions to the computer.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator, ===, sees if two values are equal and returns a Boolean result either true or false. </li>
          <li>An array is a group of related data in a variable.</li>
          <li>Index is a unique number given to the location of a data item in an array.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses a predictable pattern of indices to perform a task an all array items using a single code block executed repeatedly.</li>
          <li>The length of array lets the for loop know how many times to run code based on the ammount of items in array.</li>
          <li>Length of array can be determined by using length.</li>
          <li>The let keyword creates a variable thats value can be reassigned.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains three statements.</li>
          <li>First statement determines the starting point for the loop. Declare a variable and assign a number to it.</li>
          <li>Second statement is the condition. Loop keeps running until condition is met.</li>
          <li>Third staetement allows array to iterate over each item.</li>
          <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting the code. Use /* and */ at the beginning and end of code.</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to achieve certain tasks.</li>
          <li>Two requirements exist for a Javascript function. One define the function, and two call the function.</li>
          <li>Code block or function body instructs the computer on how to carry out the function.</li>
          <li>Declare a function using the function keyword.</li>
          <li>To call a function input the functions name.</li>
          <li>A function's name will always be followed by parantheses.</li>
          <li>The code for a functions task is added inside of curly brackets {} after the functions name.</li>
